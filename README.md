## Camus Segmentation Challenge AI for Medical Imaging
Group names: Anne Chel, Victor Kyriacou, VÄ±ctor Retamal Guiberteau, Laura Latorre Moreno

This forked repository contains the work of our group, build on top of the package CBIM-Medical-Image-Segmentation.

Segmentation and EF calculation.

### Environment
To run the env creator in Snellius, clone this repository and ```cd ./CBIM-Medical-Image-Segmentation```. Run ```sbatch env_build.sh``` in the terminal and after approx 30 mins, the environment should be created. 

To run locally: ```conda env -f create environment.yml``` and ```conda activate camus``` 

### Data
Download official CAMUS dataset from https://humanheart-project.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/database/#collection/6373703d73e9f0047faa1bc8 and put with its original structure and quality information in training/camus-dataset. Download official test dataset from camus and place in testing/camus-test-dataset

### Currently Supporting models
- [UTNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00131) (Official implementation)
- [UNet] Including 2D, 3D with different building block, e.g. double conv, Residual BasicBlock, Bottleneck, MBConv, or ConvNeXt block.
